## 🔍 Description

This project is a simple web page that uses JavaScript to dynamically create a **table of contents** from all `<h2>` headings present in the article content. It displays the list on the side of the page, allowing users to click and smoothly scroll to each section.

Additionally, a small "↑" button appears next to every `<h2>` heading, which scrolls the user back to the main table of contents when clicked.
